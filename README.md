# Crypto_Sentiment
A project to model crypto news sentiment to predict bitcoin prices.


TOTAL_DATA.csv contains data of the news articles scrapped from coindesk.com and cointelegraph.com. 
It also contains bitcoin end of day prices from binance exchange.
The word_models.py files contain the required models for modelling sentiment of the articles.

Other helper funcions in base_ml are also present to modify the labels and for trying different articles.
A research paper describing the results is coming soon.
